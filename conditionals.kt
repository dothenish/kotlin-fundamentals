//1. Write Conditionals in Kotlin

//== 
fun main() {
    println(1 == 1)
}

//<
fun main() {

}

//if statement
fun main() {
    val trafficLightColor = "Green"

    if (trafficLightColor == "Red") {
        println("Stop")

//2.Use a when statement for multiple branches

        "Green" -> println("Go")

//more complex conditions in a when statement
fun main() {
    val x = 3

        7 -> println("x is a prime number between 1 and 10.")
        else -> println("x isn't a prime number between 1 and 10.")
    }
}

//rewrite
fun main() {
    val x = 4

    when (x) {
        2, 3, 5, 7 -> println("x is a prime number between 1 and 10.")
        in 1..10 -> println("x is a number between 1 and 10, but not a prime number.")
        else -> println("x isn't a prime number between 1 and 10.")

        is Int -> println("x is an integer number, but not between 1 and 10.")
        else -> println("x isn't an integer number.")

//Add an additional condition with the same body

//3. Use if/else and when as expressions
fun main() {
